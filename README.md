# README

A rails app that builds a Pig Latin version of any article I
might want to look up in the English language wikipedia. (e.g. If I want a pig latin version of
the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin, Iâ€™d go to http://localhost/wiki/Pig_Latin and
the app would translate that article into Pig Latin for me.)
